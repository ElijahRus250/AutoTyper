# AutoTyper
This is a basic python program that you can use to paste text into the text bot and itll type it on your computer like you are using the keyboard.

This can be used to copy and paste items into a program that doesnt let you.

Packages used 
- `pyautogui` Used for the typing portion.
- `tinker` Used to create the UI
- `time` used for the delay to start

# Setup
- Install Python 3.^
- Run the `.exe` program from here

If you want to just run it from terminal install `tinker` and `pyautogui` then just run `python3 main.py`

This was my first python program ever so its basic but I find it cool, if you need help message me on discord - ElijahRus#9099 / 484411714637529088
